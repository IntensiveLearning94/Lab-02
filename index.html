            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Billings, MT. I grew up fly fishing and hiking. My dream is to one day travel to New Zealand to do some fly fishing and kayaking. My favorite thing ever is coffee. I went to public school in Redmond, WA and graduated High School in Lake Stevens, WA. I attended the University of Arizona for three years persuing a degree in History. Right out of high school I started working in retail part time. After college in Arizona I returned to Washington and started working full time. I have been with the same company for 11 years and in management for the last 5 years.</p>
